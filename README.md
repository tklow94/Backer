# Backer
---
Backer is a Go Fund Me type web applicaiton. It utilizes Postgresql for storing data and Ruby on Rails for front and backend management. Users can create projects with perk based subscription services connected to the Stripe API. User can also support projects by subscribing to these specific perks for the owner can reach their monetary goal needed to complete their project.

# Motivation
---
The main motivation for this project was to get used to reading the documentation of an API and implementing it in a project. I wanted to work specifically with the Stripe API because it is becoming a must have for any ecommerce applicaiton. I also wanted to explore more advanced features of rails such as mailers and jobs.

# Tehcnologies Used
---
# - React Hooks
  React Hooks makes it easier for me to extract and reuse code while maintaining a consistant use of functional components.
# - React Router
  React Router made redirects seamless for me, allowing redirects to pages without having to refresh the browser.
# - Rails API
  Using a Rails API gave me the ability to create an API only backend, so I could manipulate a virtual browser with React to decrease resource strain on the server.
# - Active Model Serializer
  Active Model Serializer made it easier for me to manipulate and extract data related to users, limiting the amount of code written on the frontend.
# - Cloudinary
  Cloudinary lessened the strain on my server. Instead of storing images on a local source, Cloudinary allowed me to store them in the cloud and retreive them when necessary.
# - Material UI
  Material UI was built for React. It has a large and fully customizable components. The main reason I used Material UI was because of the time constraint for this project. The large amount of ready out of the box components made design much quicker while still looking professional and feeling dynamic.
# - Edamam API
